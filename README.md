# Movie Recommendation System 🎬🎥
A Machine Learning-based Movie Recommendation System built using Python. This project suggests movies based on user preferences using data-driven algorithms. The model analyzes movie data to provide accurate and personalized recommendations to users.

##  Features
✅ Content-Based Filtering (Recommends movies similar to a selected movie)
✅ Collaborative Filtering (Recommends movies based on user behavior)
✅ Hybrid Approach (Combines both techniques for better accuracy)
✅ Interactive UI (If applicable)
✅ Scalable and Efficient Model

## Technologies Used
🔹 Python - Core programming language
🔹 Pandas & NumPy - Data manipulation and analysis
🔹 Scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms
🔹 NLTK - Text processing for movie descriptions
🔹 Cosine Similarity & TF-IDF - Content-based recommendations
🔹 Surprise Library - Collaborative filtering algorithms
🔹 Flask / Streamlit (Optional) - Web interface for the recommendation system

## Dataset
The system uses a movies dataset containing information such as:
🎞 Movie Title
📝 Genres
🗒 Overview (Description)
⭐ Ratings
🎭 Actors & Directors

## Popular datasets:

TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset
IMDb Dataset

## Installation & Setup
Install Dependencies:- pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Project:- jupyter notebook
If it's a Flask/Streamlit-based web app:- python app.py

## How It Works
1️⃣ The user inputs a movie title or interacts with a UI.
2️⃣ The system analyzes movie features (genres, actors, directors, etc.).
3️⃣ It calculates similarities between movies using machine learning models.
4️⃣ The system returns a list of recommended movies.
